Agricultural and food trade relations of the EU and the US have been controversial in the last decades. Several WTO dispute settlement processes mark the road of long and difficult negotiations between the two parties. Agriculture and food trade issues are again highly debated in the on-going Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations. The European public media discuss vividly the issue of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) trade barriers, fearing a possible downward harmonization of EU food safety standards. 
Even if the negotiating mandate of the European Council (European Council, 2014) aims at reducing SPS barriers substantially (the trade agreement would contain a so called SPS Plus chapter that would extend the bilateral commitments of the two countries beyond those under the SPS Agreement of the WTO), fears of far reaching relaxations of European food safety standards are probably ill-founded. First, in spite of the differences in regulatory approaches (BEUC, 2014), there is no clear evidence for a general superiority of the EU food safety standards compared to the US ones, which is a necessary condition for downward harmonization. Second, EU officials continuously deny that hormone-treated beef or poultry meat with chlorine based pathogen reduction treatment might get access to the EU market. Indeed, evidence from other bi-lateral trade agreements, such as the recent one between EU and Canada, show that compromises are reached in cases where the EU’s public opinion strongly objects the acceptance of the partner’s standards. Nevertheless, the economic impacts of reducing SPS and other non-tariff measures (NTM) in the context of TTIP are worth considering, and have been investigated in recent larger scale studies (e.g. ECORYS 2009; Francois et al. 2013, Bureau et al. 2014, Beckman et al. 2015). Our paper contributes to this line of research by focusing on how the simulated impacts are biased due to the small-share and zero trade flow problems, and by presenting possible remedies. To better disentangle these two sources of bias on simulation results we only focus on the EU meat markets. A detailed impact analysis of the whole agricultural sector is out of the scope of this paper.
