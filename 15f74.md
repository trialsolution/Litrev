# Abstract
This paper reviews the state of the art of two well-known deficiencies of Armington trade models: the small-share and the zero trade flow problems. Two recently proposed modifications (Witzke et al. 2005 and Kuiper and Tongeren 2006) to the standard Armington approach are systematically compared with respect to their performance in simulating the impacts of trade liberalization on emerging trade relations. Our selected test case is the EU meat market where the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement is expected to foster bilateral trade between the EU and the US by significantly lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers. This is the first attempt in the literature to implement the two approaches in the same large-scale modeling framework, making a direct comparison possible. We discuss the differences in calibrating the two modified Armington systems as well as the simulation behavior. Our results suggest that a more realistic simulation behavior can be achieved by implementing the proposed approaches in large-scale equilibrium models, especially when trade is expected to emerge due to lowering trade barriers. One of our key empirical results with the proposed approaches is a quantitative assessment of emerging US poultry exports to the EU in a consistent equilibrium modelling framework.
